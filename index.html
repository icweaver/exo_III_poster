          ACCESS is a multi-institutional collaboration initiated in 2014 and
          aimed at exploring the visible (0.35 – 1.0 μm) properties of
          exoplanet atmospheres using the technique of transmission
          spectroscopy. Working in this range allows for degeneracies in
          retrieved transmission spectra to be broken when combined with data
          in the IR. To date, ACCESS has gathered over 55 transits for 17
          unique targets spanning from super-Earths to hot-Jupiters using the
          IMACS multi-object spectrograph on the 6.5-m Magellan Baade Telescope
          at Las Campanas Observatory. ACCESS will provide a uniform, large
          sample of visible transmission spectra of these exoplanets, which
          will become key in the era of JWST and comparative exoplanetology.
          Here, we give an update on the current progress of our survey and
          share new detrending tools that may significantly increase the
          performance of current techniques in the field.

            On the left, we show ACCESS targets represented in planet radius vs.
            equilibrium temperature (T<sub>eq</sub>) parameter space. Circles
            indicate planets we have already published (green), planets with
            complete data sets and with results either submitted or currently
            in preparation (orange), and planets we are still observing (red).
            Grey dots show the distribution of known transiting exoplanets with
            T<sub>eq</sub> and radius measurements. The vertical dashed lines
            indicate transition temperatures for different molecules expected
            in exoplanet atmospheres. The vertical grey-shaded area show
            temperatures in which metal and silicate oxides are expected.
            On the right, we show the associated transmission spectra produced
            by our survey for both published and a selection of in prep. work.

          <p>
          Our survey produces high quality transmission spectra of exoplanet
          atmopsheres by combining observations of multiple transit events
          observed on Magellan/IMACS. We use the wide field of view of the
          spectrograph to hammer down systematics via multi-object slit
          spectroscopy of multiple comparison stars that we are able to capture
          within the same field. To perform the detrending, we simultaneously
          use i) a transit model, ii) various external systematic parameters
          (e.g. airmass, rotator angle, shift in wavelength of the trace) which
          are passed as input to a Gaussian Process (GP) kernel, and iii)
          successive components of the comparison star flux via principal
          component analysis (PCA). We fit these items via dynamic nested
          sampling<sup>1</sup> and finally Bayesian Model Average (BMA) the
          results together to produce the final detrended light curves to be
          used for atmospheric retrieval.<br><br>

          These techniques have proven successful in the past<sup>2, 3</sup>,
          but the process can take on the order of days or weeks, depending on
          the number of data points used (i.e. number of points in the
          timeseries, number comparison stars, number of wavelength bins).  We
          also recognize that this bottleneck will only be exacerbated in the
          era of "big data" surveys (e.g. TESS, JWST, Vera C. Rubin
          Observatory). For this reason, we investigate using more modern
          computational tools implemented in the probabilistic modeling
          toolkit, <em>exoplanet</em><sup>4</sup> to keep pace with the ever
          evolving field of exoplanet atmosphere research, and present our
          preliminary results here.

          <h3><span style='color:#ffffff'>Model<span></h3>
          <p>
          <em>exoplanet</em> fits exoplanet data by extending the scalable
          high-performance model building language and inference engine,
          PyMC3<sup>5</sup>, to support many of the custom functions and
          distributions that we use. These include a fast and robust solver for
          Kepeler's equations, scalable GPs using celerite, fast and accurate
          limb darkened light curves using starry<sup>6, 7</sup>, and common
          reparameterizations for limb darkening parameters<sup>8</sup>, planet
          radius and impact parameter.  These functions also have methods for
          efficiently calculating their gradients so that they can be used with
          gradient-based inference methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, No
          U-Turns Sampling, and variational inference, which all already come
          pre-baked in PyMC3, along with Theano tensors<sup>9</sup> for
          additional speed-up.

          We implemented these tools with our current data and were able to
          produce the following white light curve results.

          <p>
          Although these are only preliminary results of our implementation, we
          were pleased to see that we were able to obtain these results in
          under three minutes on a standard laptop. For comparison, this
          originally took over 5 hours to run using our standard detrending and
          sampling scheme. What is especially exciting to see is the
          potentially substantial reduction in the transit depth uncertainty
          using this new framework.<br><br>

          We would also like to note that the discrepancies seen above are most
          likely due to the choice of kernel. The <em>exoplanet</em> run uses a
          matern-3/2 kernel, while our original study used a
          squared-exponential, which has since been seen to be less reliable
          and has had support for it dropped in modern GP packages
          (<a href='https://github.com/dfm/celerite/issues/147' target='_blank'>#147</a>,

          Our sample implementation on a recently collected HAT-P-23b dataset
          also looks promising.

          We have four more complete datasets for this target that we will also
          test this new implementation on. They are currently in the process of
          being reduced and wavelength calibrated.

          <h3><span style='color:#ffffff'>Discussion and Conclusion</span></h3>
          <p>
          We present the first preliminary results of the implementation of
          <em>exoplanet</em> on our ACCESS data. The significantly reduced run
          time and easily extendible and composable nature of distributions and
          models in PyMC3 makes the iterative approach to developing detrending
          schemes much more rapid.<br><br>

          Our next steps will involve extending to binned light curves to
          produce transmission spectra from raw data on the order of minutes.
          With these spectra in hand, we will then investigate the effect of
          different priors and GP kernels on the final transmission spectrum,
          and how this ultimately impacts the characteristics of its atmosphere
          inferred from retrieval analysis.
